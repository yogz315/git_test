This file was created to learn how to use the touch command on the Linux terminal.  
Also, in the process I just learned how to open a terminal editor to modify contents in
a text file. 

This editor is called GNU nano, but can be calle din the terminal window by using:

editor fileName.extension

example:
editor README.txt
